INTRO

The perl_tools repository is a collection of Perl based tools to help
players and Game Masters (GMs, alternately DMs) generate Non-Player
Characters. 

For example, use "chargen.pl" to generate a single character:

```
  bin/chargen.pl
  Ilda Bouchet [F] 785576 
```

The "roll_dice.pl" code takes an optional "--roll <INT>" and provides 2d6 rols.

```
  bin/roll_dice.pl --rolls 4
  8 7 4 12
```

The "crewgen.pl" program uses a CSV data file and creates a crew for 
whatever ship matches the "name". 

```
  bin/crewgen.pl --config data/ships.csv --name 'Miss Rosa'
  Miss Rosa
